It was not by chance that those elements combined to create the goliath that is suffocating New York, and it is not by chance that a Roosevelt is the only one who can kill it.</p>\n<p>His father's looks, his speaking voice, his smile, his charm, his charisma. Franklin Delano Roosevelt Junior is a spitting image of his father in nearly every way. Coming back from World War II with a Silver Star, \"Brud\" easily won election to Congress as a Liberal in a 1949 special election. His eyes have always been set on greater things, however, and he would retire from Congress to take a shot at the 1954 Gubernatorial. Unfortunately, Carmine DeSapio had other plans, and Roosevelt could only watch as Averell Harriman won a ticket to Albany that November instead, leaving him to drown against Jacob Javits in the Attorney General race.</p><p> Ever since DeSapio swindled him out of the Governorship, Junior has been waiting for the perfect opportunity to return to politics. This is that opportunity. Rockefeller's failure to tackle crime and DeSapio's mob ties have created a golden opportunity for Roosevelt to wrongfoot them both. That being said, his path is narrow; Dubinsky's Liberal Party has never won a statewide race independently, and national allies, including the Kennedys, are uncharacteristically quiet. But everyone's ought to know better than to underestimate a Roosevelt.</p>",
